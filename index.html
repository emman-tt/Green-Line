                    <p>“Refreshing and Natural”</p>
                    <div>Green Line drinks are genuinely refreshing.
                        What I love most is that they’re made with natural ingredients and no artificial sweeteners.
                        Their lemon-mint flavor tastes like something you'd make at home.
                        It’s a perfect go-to for a post-workout drink or a sunny afternoon.</div>

                    <p>“Elegant Packaging, Clean Taste”</p>
                    <div>The packaging is sleek, modern, and eco-friendly, which already puts Green Line ahead of many
                    brands.
                    I tried the cucumber-lime flavor and was impressed by how clean and crisp it tasted.
                    It’s light on the palate but still flavorful.
                    This is a brand I’d proudly serve to guests or bring to a picnic.</div>

                    <p> “Too Subtle for Me”</p>
                   <div> While I appreciate Green Line’s focus on health and simplicity, the flavors felt too subtle for my
                    liking.
                    I expected more zest or boldness from their berry mix drink.
                    Maybe it's perfect for someone who prefers lightly flavored water, but I wanted more punch.
                    Still, I respect their low-calorie approach and transparency.

                <p> “A Game Changer for Healthy Living”</p>
               <div>Green Line has completely changed how I hydrate during the day.
                I’ve replaced soda and sugary juices with their herbal-infused line, and I feel the difference.
                The ginger-peach blend is a personal favorite—it’s warming and soothing without being overwhelming.
                Plus, knowing it's all natural helps me stick to my health goals.</div>

                </p>
                <div>
                At first, I hesitated because Green Line is priced a little higher than typical drinks.
                But after trying a few flavors, I understood the value.
                They use real herbs and fruit extracts, and nothing feels synthetic.
                If you care about quality and what goes into your body, this brand is worth every cent.

                <p> “Best Office Fridge Staple”</p>
                We stock Green Line in our office, and it's everyone's favorite grab-and-go drink.
                It's light enough to keep you refreshed during long meetings but flavorful enough to feel like a treat.
                The basil-lime flavor in particular is always the first to go.
                It's definitely helped us cut down on energy drinks and soda.
